2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Q_A/D/state_reg_LDC_i_1__2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Q_A/D/state_reg_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Q_A/D/state_reg_LDC_i_2__2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Q_A/D/state_reg_C/CLR, Q_A/D/state_reg_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Q_B/D/state_reg_LDC_i_1__1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Q_B/D/state_reg_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#4 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Q_B/D/state_reg_LDC_i_2__1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Q_B/D/state_reg_C/CLR, Q_B/D/state_reg_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#5 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Q_C/D/state_reg_LDC_i_1__0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Q_C/D/state_reg_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#6 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Q_C/D/state_reg_LDC_i_2__0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Q_C/D/state_reg_C/CLR, Q_C/D/state_reg_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#7 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Q_D/D/state_reg_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Q_D/D/state_reg_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#8 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Q_D/D/state_reg_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Q_D/D/state_reg_C/CLR, Q_D/D/state_reg_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
